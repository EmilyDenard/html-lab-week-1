    <h1>Forrest Gump</h1>

    <p>
      Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as
      disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads
      anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a
      college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat,
      Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person
      Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his
      childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).
